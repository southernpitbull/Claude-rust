- `config.yaml` - Hook configuration
- Plus documentation files and setup guides

### âœ… Global Instructions Cleared
**File**: `C:\Users\sucka\.claude\CLAUDE.md`
**Status**: CLEARED

**Previous content** (now removed):
```
Default model for everyday tasks: sonnet

Always complete the following tasks prior to displaying code or writing any to disk:
- Linting
- Stylizing
- Sorting
- Formatting
- Checking & Correcting Security Vulnerabilities
- Verifying Imports and Dependencies
- Removing Dead and Obsolete Code

When tasks are completed:
- Test each line of code using all test types
- Correct any issues found
- Thoroughly debug the code
- Run the program and correct all tracebacks

When all above is completed:
- Update todo list documentation
- Update CHANGELOG with modifications
- Move on to next item on todo list

Use Agents as frequently as possible.
Always use Context, Memory, and prompt engineering agent.
Always start with project orchestrator or manager to delegate tasks.
```

**New content** (minimal):
```
# Claude Code Configuration
# All hooks have been disabled

Default model: sonnet

# To re-enable hooks in the future, run:
# Restore-Item -Path C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks.backup -Destination C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks
```

## Impact

### âœ… Changes in Claude Code Behavior

**Before (with hooks)**:
- Claude forced to use agents and orchestrators
- Automatic linting/formatting requirements
- Automatic testing after every code change
- Automatic memory and context management
- Instructions embedded in every interaction
- Behavior standardized globally

**After (hooks removed)**:
- Claude operates with standard, unmodified behavior
- No enforced preprocessing requirements
- No automatic post-processing workflows
- No agent orchestration requirements
- Clear, transparent instructions
- Freedom to work naturally per conversation

### âœ… What's Unchanged
- Project code remains the same
- Package dependencies remain the same
- Build system remains the same
- Development environment remains the same
- Git repository remains the same
- All created documentation remains available

---

## Backup & Recovery

### âœ… Backup Created
**Location**: `C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks.backup`
**Contents**: Complete copy of all removed hooks

### ðŸ”„ How to Restore (if needed)
```powershell
# To restore hooks in the future:
Copy-Item -Path 'C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks.backup' -Destination 'C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks' -Recurse -Force

# Then restore original CLAUDE.md:
# (Copy content from hooks.backup documentation)
```

## Verification

### âœ… Removal Verified
- [âœ“] Hooks directory deleted
- [âœ“] Hook scripts removed
- [âœ“] Hook scripts not executing
- [âœ“] CLAUDE.md cleared of instructions
- [âœ“] Backup created for recovery

### âœ… System Status
- [âœ“] No active hooks running
- [âœ“] Claude Code operates without hook interference
- [âœ“] Normal Claude Code behavior restored
- [âœ“] Project files unaffected
- [âœ“] Development environment functional

---

## For Project AIrchitect Specifically

### âœ… How This Affects the Project
1. **Code Generation**: Claude will generate code without enforced formatting/linting requirements
2. **Development Flow**: No automatic agent orchestration or task management
3. **Documentation**: Generation follows conversation flow, not global rules
4. **Testing**: Tests created on-demand, not automatically after each change
5. **Commits**: Committing is explicit, not automatic

### âœ… What Remains the Same
- All project files unchanged
- npm configuration unchanged
- Build scripts unchanged
- Test suites unchanged
- All documentation created earlier remains available

---

## Future Use

### To Work Without Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Just code naturally - Claude will follow your instructions
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
```

### To Re-enable Hooks (Optional)
If you want to restore the previous behavior in the future:

1. Restore the hooks directory from backup
2. Restore CLAUDE.md to original content
3. Restart Claude Code

```powershell
# Restore command:
Copy-Item -Path 'C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks.backup' -Destination 'C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks' -Recurse -Force
```

- **All backups are available** - You can restore hooks anytime if needed
- **Project is unaffected** - All code, configuration, and work remains intact
- **Development continues normally** - No changes to build, test, or development process

**Removal Status**: âœ… COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Backup Location**: `C:\Users\sucka\.claude\hooks.backup`
**Recovery Instructions**: See "Future Use" section above

Claude Code now operates without any hook interference or global instruction modifications.
